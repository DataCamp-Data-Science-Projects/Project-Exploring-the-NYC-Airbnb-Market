As a result, there are many <a href=\"https://www.airbnb.com/\"><em>Airbnb</em></a> listings in New York City to meet the high demand for temporary lodging for anywhere between a few nights to many months. In this notebook, we will take a closer look at the New York Airbnb market by combining data from multiple file types like <code>.csv</code>, <code>.tsv</code>, and <code>.xlsx</code> (Excel files).</p>\n","<p>A <strong>CSV</strong>, or comma-separated-values, file is one of the most common ways that tabular data is stored. In a CSV file, each value is separated by a comma and each row is separated by a newline. Since this file format is so widely used and is non-proprietary, it's great for sharing data with others and can be parsed by a variety of software.</p>\n","<pre><code>\"listing_id\",\"price\",\"nbhood_full\"\n","2595,\"225 dollars\",\"Manhattan, Midtown\"\n","3831,\"89 dollars\",\"Brooklyn, Clinton Hill\"\n","5099,\"200 dollars\",\"Manhattan, Murray Hill\"\n","</code></pre>\n","<p>A <strong>TSV</strong>, or tab-separated-values, file is similar to a CSV file, but tabs are used to separate values rather than commas:</p>\n","<pre><code>listing_id    host_name   last_review\n","2595    Jennifer    May 21 2019\n","3831    LisaRoxanne July 05 2019\n","5099    Chris   June 22 2019\n","</code></pre>\n","<p><strong>Excel files</strong> are often used by spreadsheet users. Excel files contain information about formatting and formulas created in Excel, but these things aren't usually necessary when working with data in R. Excel files can also contain multiple tables, so these files need to be imported carefully to make sure the correct table is used. The Excel file format is also proprietary, so there's a more limited pool of software that can read it.</p>\n","<p><img src=\"https://assets.datacamp.com/production/project_1230/img/airbnb_room_type.png\" alt=\"Excel file\" width=\"700px\"></p>\n","<p>The three files that are available contain data on 2019 Airbnb listings.
